# Robust Botnet DGA Detection: Blending XAI and OSINT for Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing
## Description 
This project focuses on **detecting botnet-generated domain names (DGA domains)** using a combination of **Explainable AI (XAI) and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** techniques. Our approach improves cyber threat intelligence sharing by enhancing transparency in model predictions and leveraging real-time threat intelligence data.  
## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luongpd2313/NT140-CyberSecurity.git
cd NT140-CyberSecurity/DGA-Detection
python BotnetDGAwithXAI.py
```
